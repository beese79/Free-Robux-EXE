# Free-Robux-EXE
## The one joke program that uhh... *doesn't* give robux.
Hello! I made this really crappy software made with Visual Studio.

No, this does not give robux. Yes, I am incredibly stupid.

I'm pretty sure this program requires the latest version of Microsoft .NET framework (4.8). Here's how to check if you have the Microsoft .NET 4.8 framework.

1. Click the search icon or box on your taskbar. If you don't have search in your taskbar, right click your taskbar then go to *Search* then click on either *Show Search Icon* or *Show Search Box*.![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72896961/141380671-d24d260c-5c70-40de-9e68-cd68c458c2b8.png)

2. Type in "Features" in the search box/panel. Then click *Turn Windows features on or off*.![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72896961/141380949-bb6946be-b3ce-46c1-bbd5-83d3909998c3.png)

3. Make sure *.NET Framework 4.8 Advanced Services* has a square in the middle of the check box. If it does not, click on the check box.![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72896961/141381367-b7548f1b-faff-483e-9e0b-259122f8b3b0.png)

4. If you need to click the check box, restart your PC to apply the changes.

### That's how to check if you have the .NET framework. If you have the framework, the program should run no problem.

Thank you for reading. If you are having troubles, submit an issue.
